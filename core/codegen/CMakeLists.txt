# OV codegen is build in two single CMake targets: A static library `ov_codegen_lib` and the actual executable
# `ov_codegen`, which depends on the library. The `acplt_builder` tool is build and linked against the library, too.
# 
# * The `ov_codegen_lib` contains the parser, generated by flex and bison. It also requires the header file
#   `ov_codegen.h` to build.
# * The executable `ov_codegen` is build from the `ov_codegen.c`, which contains the main() function and all the
#   code generation stuff.
